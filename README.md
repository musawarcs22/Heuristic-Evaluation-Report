# Heuristic-Evaluation-Report
This above report was developed after performing the heuristic evaluation.

A heuristic evaluation is a technique that is used to improve the user interface (UI) design of
computer software. It is usually done in groups to analyze software from multiple angles so that
different problems could be identified. The evaluators involved in the process independently
analyzed the UI of the software based on internationally recognized usability principles also
called “heuristics”. The evaluators individually and independently examine the user interface for
about one to two hours for evaluation. The evaluators don't collaborate until their evaluations
are complete to have a neutral (actual) and unbiased opinion.
